## Overview

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.png)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

Looked at the image and setup my html first, then worked on the project with plain css and then converted that over to tailwind as I learned tailwind.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwindcss


### What I learned

I used this project to practice setting up a project and using tailwind for the first time. I learned how to use flexbox and grid with tailwindcss and how it compares to vanilla css. I also learned how to submit a solution on Frontend Mentor using github for the first time.

### Continued development

I want to continue practicing frontend projects using tailwind and learn how to better use github as well.
